2. Unzip it.
3. Make sure that node v14.8.0 is installed.
4. Run "npm install" or "yarn install".
5. Run "npm start" or "yarn start".

Additional functionalities implemented:
1. There is a delete button with each list item, which would delete that item.
2. The yellow button on the top displays the number of clicks a user make.

Thoughts about ranking:

1. Ranking of each list item can be done by sorting the list alphabetically.
2. It can also be done on the basis of the date that the entry was added. (Most recent to oldest)
